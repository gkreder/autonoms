Introduction
============

``mocha-ms`` is a Python package for automated mass spectrometry runs combining instrument control and data analysis. 
In its current form, ``mocha-ms`` is written around the Agilent RapidFire (365), 6560 IM-QTOF system, and Skyline small molecule
data analysis. However, it may be adapted further for additional instrumentation or analysis workflows.

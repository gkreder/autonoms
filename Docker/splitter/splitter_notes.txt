10 = startTime (seconds)
13 = endTime (seconds)


second 0 flag sets no mass hunter delay. 1 sets for delay. -1 does nothing.

test_blaze_splitting/sequence1.d is the full run sequence
test_blaze_splitting/Inj0000*.d are the outputs from the (incorrect) built-in agilent file splitting
test_blaze_splitting/RFDatabase.xml is the full RapidFire metadata file
test_blaze_splitting/batch.rftime is a brief RapidFire metadata file (but not enough for file splitting I think)
